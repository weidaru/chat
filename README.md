How to Use:
1. Start the ServerView.exe in ./TcpClient/ServerView/bin/Release
2. Start the ClientView.exe with a username in ./TcpClient/ClientView/bin/Release
3. Send some message from the client app so that it could be acknowledged by the server.

TIP:
1. Several clients could be talking to the server at the same time. 
   Remember to use different user names.
2. In server app, target user which we want to talk to could be switched using the combo box.
3. Close the client before closing the server.
